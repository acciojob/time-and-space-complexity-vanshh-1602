	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

	<p>Time Complexity measures how the execution time of an algorithm increases with input size and is crucial for evaluating how efficient the algorithm is. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize time complexity to ensure faster performance for larger datasets. Common time complexities include O(1) (constant time), which is highly efficient, O(log n) (logarithmic time), which scales well, and O(n) (linear time), where execution time increases proportionally with input size. Less efficient complexities, such as O(n²) (quadratic time) or O(2ⁿ) (exponential time), can cause significant delays for large inputs.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the memory usage of an algorithm relative to the input size, focusing on how efficiently memory is utilized. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize space usage while maintaining performance. A common complexity is O(n) (linear space), where memory consumption grows directly with input size, often seen when storing arrays, lists, or recursion stacks. More memory-intensive algorithms may have higher space complexities, such as O(n²), which can limit their scalability in memory-constrained environments.</p>
